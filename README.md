# Visible-Language-Projects

## Description

These are 4 projects that I developed while working for under Dr. Paul Fields from January 2020 - March 2020. Each project was meant to be a visualization
of Book of Mormon data for a project Dr. Fields was working on. Each of the projects is completed to different extents and the specific status of each 
is listed in each individual folder's README file.

This repo was originally intended to be used by my successor to pick up where I left off on the remaining work.
